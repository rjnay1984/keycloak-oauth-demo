# Keycloak Oauth Demo

The purpose of this repo is documentation on how to handle oauth strategies, since I keep forgetting how I did it previously.

I'm using keycloak because of the cost (free!) and the versatility, however, most of the logic I add here SHOULD translate to more familiar oauth providers, such as Azure AD, Cognito, or Auth0.

## Setup

- Run `docker compose up`
- Visit `http://localhost:8080`
- Click `Administration Console`
- Login with username `admin`, password `admin`
